## Keeping standard logos

Previously, we had saving logos on this directory. However, we're trying to migrate to the CMS implementation.

If you need to add / update a logo, first try to follow the CMS steps, if it's impossible to integrate the CMS for some reason, then use this folder to save the logo, and keep this in mind:

# Partners:
- Black logo
- in .png format
- name should be in lowecase `gelato.png`
- name should only be one word, for example `gelato_network.png` will raise errors in the Testimonial component
